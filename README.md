# Travel Invoices Classifier

A Google Apps Script project that turns a folder of travel-invoice PDFs and phone photos into a structured Google Sheet, classifies each expense against a written company policy + your trip itinerary, and files the originals into `Allowed` / `Not_Allowed` / `Needs_Review` subfolders with cleanly renamed filenames.

Uses Gemini or Claude (your choice, your API key) for the LLM calls.

## What it does

1. **Extract** — for every PDF / image in a Drive folder, calls the LLM to pull out date, currency, amount, vendor, city, country, and a natural-language description. Writes everything to a Google Sheet called `Invoice_Details` in the same folder.
2. **Classify** — reads a `Policy.txt` and any itinerary files (PDFs, text, Google Docs) from the folder, then asks the LLM to judge each invoice as `Allowed`, `Not Allowed`, or `Needs Review`, with a one-sentence reason citing the policy clause or itinerary fact.
3. **Move + rename** — physically moves each invoice into the matching subfolder and renames it to `YYYYMMDD_CCY_Amount_Vendor.ext` (e.g. `20260423_GBP_18_Giraffe Heathrow T3.jpg`) for easy human review.

All three steps are independent functions, so you can pause between them to sanity-check the sheet before files get moved.

## Folder layout

```
<your invoice folder>/
├── Policy.txt              ← edit with your company's expense rules
├── Itinerary/              ← drop trip PDFs / Google Docs here
│   ├── flights.pdf
│   └── trip-notes  (a Google Doc with Perk / TripIt links)
├── Invoice_Details         ← the output sheet (auto-created)
├── Itinerary_Resolved      ← optional debug doc (auto-created on demand)
├── Allowed/                ← auto-created on first move
├── Not_Allowed/            ← auto-created on first move
├── Needs_Review/           ← auto-created on first move
└── <your invoices>         ← drop PDFs and phone photos here
```

## Run modes

The same code works in two modes — pick whichever fits how you want to use it:

- **Container-bound (recommended).** The script lives inside the `Invoice_Details` Google Sheet itself. You get an "Invoice Tools" menu in the sheet's menu bar (run everything from there, no Apps Script editor needed), and sharing the sheet via a `/copy` link gives colleagues a fully isolated installation with their own API key.
- **Standalone.** The script lives at <https://script.google.com> as its own project, separate from any sheet. Useful if you'd rather not bind to a specific sheet, or if you want one script driving multiple folders.

## Setup — container-bound (recommended)

1. In Drive, open (or create) an empty Google Sheet to use as the project home. Naming it `Invoice_Details` keeps things consistent, but the name doesn't matter functionally.
2. Inside the sheet, click **Extensions → Apps Script**. This creates a new project bound to that sheet.
3. Create four script files matching this repo and paste in `Config.gs`, `Extraction.gs`, `Classification.gs`, `MoveFiles.gs`. Delete the default `Code.gs`.
4. In `Config.gs`, set:
   - `FOLDER_ID` — from the Drive URL `https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/<FOLDER_ID>` (your invoices folder; can be different from where the sheet lives).
   - `LLM_PROVIDER` — `'gemini'` or `'claude'`.
5. Project Settings (gear icon) → Script Properties → add either `GEMINI_API_KEY` or `CLAUDE_API_KEY`.
   - Gemini key: <https://aistudio.google.com/apikey>
   - Claude key: <https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys>
6. Save, reload the sheet — an **Invoice Tools** menu appears in the menu bar.
7. First time you pick anything from that menu, Apps Script asks for OAuth approval (Drive, Sheets, Docs, External URL).

## Setup — standalone

1. Go to <https://script.google.com> → New project.
2. Same step 3 onward as above (create the four files, set `FOLDER_ID` + `LLM_PROVIDER`, add the Script Property key).
3. Run `extractInvoices` from the editor and approve the OAuth scopes.

In standalone mode the script auto-creates the `Invoice_Details` sheet inside `FOLDER_ID` on first run.

## Day-to-day use

Drop new invoices into the folder, then either:

- **Container-bound mode**: use the **Invoice Tools** menu in the sheet → *Extract / Classify / Move + rename / Run all / Debug: dump resolved itinerary*.
- **Standalone mode**: in the Apps Script editor, click Run on one of these functions:

  - `extractInvoices` — fills in sheet rows for any files not already in it.
  - `classifyInvoices` — fills in `Classification` + `Classification_Reason` for rows that don't yet have a verdict.
  - `moveClassifiedFiles` — moves + renames files according to the sheet.
  - `runAll` — extract → classify → move, in one click.
  - `dumpResolvedItinerary` — writes a `Itinerary_Resolved` Google Doc showing exactly what itinerary text reaches the LLM (with every URL in your itinerary expanded via Jina Reader). Useful for debugging classification quality.

## Sheet schema (`Invoice_Details` tab)

The script always reads from and writes to a tab named **`Invoice_Details`** (auto-created on first run if missing). Any other tabs you add — notes, pivots, dashboards, summaries — are left completely alone. The tab name is set by `CONFIG.SHEET_NAME`; change it if you want a different tab name (also used as the spreadsheet filename in standalone mode).


| Column | Notes |
|---|---|
| `File_Name` | Updated after rename so the next run can still find the file. |
| `File_Link` | Direct Drive URL to the invoice. |
| `Date` | Transaction date in `YYYY-MM-DD`. Blanked if the model couldn't read it confidently. |
| `Date_Raw` | Verbatim date string as printed on the receipt — debug aid for the `Date` column. |
| `Currency` | 3-letter ISO code. |
| `Amount` | Grand total as a number. |
| `Vendor Name` | Merchant name. |
| `City` | Transaction city (e.g. `Garden Grove`, not `California`). |
| `Country` | 2-letter ISO code. |
| `Invoice Description` | Short natural-language summary. |
| `Detailed_Description` | Richer summary with venue, time, items. Food/drink rows are tagged `including alcoholic drinks` or `no alcoholic drinks`. |
| `Classification` | `Allowed` / `Not Allowed` / `Needs Review`. |
| `Classification_Reason` | One-sentence justification citing the policy or itinerary. |

## Configuration knobs (`Config.gs`)

| Setting | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `SKIP_PROCESSED` | `true` | Skip files already in the sheet on re-extraction. |
| `RECLASSIFY_ALL` | `false` | When `true`, classify overwrites rows that already have a verdict — useful after editing `Policy.txt`. |
| `POLICY_BASENAME` | `Policy` | Looked up as `Policy.txt`, `Policy.md`, `Policy.pdf`, or a Google Doc named `Policy`. |
| `ITINERARY_SUBFOLDER` | `Itinerary` | Subfolder scanned for trip files. |
| `ALLOWED_SUBFOLDER` / `NOT_ALLOWED_SUBFOLDER` / `REVIEW_SUBFOLDER` | `Allowed` / `Not_Allowed` / `Needs_Review` | Where files land after classification. |
| `GEMINI_MODEL` / `CLAUDE_MODEL` | `gemini-2.5-flash` / `claude-sonnet-4-5` | Bump up for harder receipts. |

## Itinerary tips

- Plain PDFs (flights, hotel confirmations) work directly.
- A Google Doc with a list of trip-management URLs (Perk, TripIt, etc.) also works — link contents get fetched via Jina Reader (`r.jina.ai`) and inlined as text before the LLM call.
- Always include the year somewhere in the doc. Many trip-share pages render dates as "Mon 9 Feb" with no year, which forces the LLM to guess.
- Run `dumpResolvedItinerary` after editing to confirm every URL was fetched successfully (the doc shows per-file `fetched OK` vs `failed` counts).

## File naming on move

`<YYYYMMDD>_<CCY>_<Amount>_<Vendor>.<ext>`

Examples:

- `20260423_GBP_18_Giraffe Heathrow T3.jpg`
- `20260504_USD_82.38_URBAN PUNJAB.jpg`
- `20260512_INR_524_HMSHost Services India Pvt Ltd.jpg`

If any of `Date` / `Currency` / `Amount` / `Vendor Name` is missing, the rename is skipped (the file still moves under its original name). Collisions get `_2`, `_3`, … suffixes.

## Sharing with colleagues (container-bound mode)

**Always share via a "Make a copy" link.** Do *not* give colleagues Edit access on your own sheet — bound scripts are visible to anyone with edit access to the container, which means they could read your API key from Script Properties.

How to send a safe link:

1. Copy your sheet's normal URL — `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/<ID>/edit`.
2. Replace the trailing `/edit` (or anything after `<ID>/`) with `/copy`.
3. Send that URL.

When they click it, Google prompts them to "Make a copy". They get:

- A brand-new sheet in their Drive, with all four `.gs` files bound to it.
- **Empty Script Properties** — they must add their own `GEMINI_API_KEY` / `CLAUDE_API_KEY` before anything runs.
- Their own `FOLDER_ID` to point at their own invoices folder.
- Their own `Policy.txt` and `Itinerary/` files in that folder.

Their data, key, folder, and policy are fully isolated from yours.

For standalone mode, sharing follows the same idea: in the Apps Script editor, Share → set permissions → "Anyone with the link can view" and have colleagues File → Make a copy of the project. Same isolation rule — never give Edit on your original project.

## Troubleshooting

- **`renamed=0` after a move** — usually means `Date` / `Currency` / `Amount` / `Vendor Name` is blank on every row. Check the sheet.
- **Wrong date extracted** — compare `Date` vs `Date_Raw`. If `Date_Raw` is also wrong, the photo is illegible or rotated badly. If `Date_Raw` is right but `Date` is wrong, the locale disambiguation got it (e.g. `05/04` could be May 4 or Apr 5); add `Country` to the receipt's region or extend `Policy.txt` with a hint.
- **`Date_Raw` shows pattern from Order ID / Auth Code** — the prompt already calls these out; if it keeps happening, switch `LLM_PROVIDER` to the heavier model (`gemini-2.5-pro` or Claude Sonnet) for that row.
- **Jina link scraping silently failing** — run `dumpResolvedItinerary` and grep for `JINA FAILED` in the resulting doc.
- **HEIC photos failing on Claude** — Claude's image API doesn't accept HEIC. Either convert to JPEG before upload, or switch `LLM_PROVIDER` to `'gemini'`.

## File-by-file

| File | What's inside |
|---|---|
| `Config.gs` | Shared `CONFIG`, `HEADERS`, `runAll()`, sheet helpers (`getOrCreateSheet`, `normalizeClass`, `stripFences`). |
| `Extraction.gs` | `extractInvoices`, the extraction prompt, LLM calls (`callGemini` / `callClaude`), and `normalizeExtracted` for date validation. |
| `Classification.gs` | `classifyInvoices`, `dumpResolvedItinerary`, policy + itinerary loaders, `extractLinksToMarkdown`, and the classification LLM calls. |
| `MoveFiles.gs` | `moveClassifiedFiles`, filename builder, collision handling, folder helpers. |
